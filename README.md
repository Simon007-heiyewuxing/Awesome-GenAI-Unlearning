This repository contains a list of papers on Generative AI Machine Unlearning based on our survey paper: [**Machine Unlearning in Generative AI: A Survey**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11518) (*[Zheyuan (Frank) Liu](https://franciscoliu.github.io/), [Guangyao Dou](https://guangyaodou.github.io/), [Zhaoxuan Tan](https://zhaoxuan.info/), [Yijun Tian]([https://franciscoliu.github.io/](https://www.yijuntian.com/)) and [Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/)*).
We categorize existing works based on their [approaches](), modality and [applications](). Additionally, we include datasets and benchmarks for various unlearning scenarios. 

We will try to make this list updated. If you find any error or any missed paper, please don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.
